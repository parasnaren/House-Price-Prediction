# House-Price-Prediction

Part of *Orient Bell Data Innovation Challenge*, where a normalised RMSE leaderboard score of **99.968** was achieved.

A regression analysis, where the predictive estimation of house prices were to be made based on the dataset of housing attributes provided as part of the Hackathon. 

*Public Leaderboard rank of 9*

### Methodology

In this notebook we have described and implemented methods through which we were able to generate our regression models for the prediction task. We have used a combination of supervised ML models and Neural networks to compare the results. Stacked Average modelling was also done for predictions.
